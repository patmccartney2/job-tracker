Project: Little Shop Redux

Group Member Names: Pat and Ben

Project Expectations:
What does each group member hope to get out of this project?
Pat- I want to become more familiar with the new testing frameworks.
Ben- I want to get better at active record


Goals and expectations:
To build a minimally pretty, but functional job tracking app.

Team strengths:
Ben has fallen down CSS holes before.
Pat is not comfortable saying he has a strength at this point in the module

How to overcome obstacles:
When faced with an obstacle we will consult eachother on slack through code snippets/screen-sharing, if that fails we will reach out to the rest of the class, if that fails we will try upperclassmen/teachers/mentors.

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually?): We plan on starting the project working together and once we have a handle on what else is needed, we will divide the remaining tasks between us working remote,

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open?):We're going to use slack for primary communication.  

Abilities Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
Patrick- I want to get more comfortable with Rspec and Rails
Ben- I want to get better with active record and html.erb syntaxes.

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
We will work on the start of the project together and then divide the remaining equally between us.

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests): No one will merge their own pull requests unless absolutely necessary.  This will make sure no unreviewed code will make it into master.  We will use comments on our PR's to explain what is going on if not apparent.

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
We expect all feedback to be KIND SPECIFIC AND IMMEDIATELY ACTIONABLE.
